# Equity-Strive-Capital-ESC-Risk-Management

## 1. Introduction

The project aims to develop a Value-at-Risk model that estimates the maximum potential loss in a
portfolio with equal investment in top 5 performing stocks from 2020 to date.The major is is to try to
see if the current upward movement in stock prices is sustainable or just the beginning of th end and
if the portfolio is at risk of losing value. This study will assume a a factious portfolio called Equity
Strive Capital. The portfolio will be made up of the following stocks: Google (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL),
Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Nvidia (NVDA).

The project is inspired by the following needs:
* Market Analysis: Investigate whether the recent upward trend in stock prices, particularly in the technology sector, represents a stable growth opportunity or signals an impending downturn. Can an all tech portfolio be profitable from this?

* Risk Management: Utilize VaR to quantify potential losses in the portfolio, aiding in informed decision-making about risk exposure amidst market volatility.


## 3. Objectives 

The objectives of this study are as follows:
* To develop a VaR model from 5 best performing tech stocks

* To come up with insights on how to manage risk in 2024.

## 4. Methodd

The study will be conducted in the following steps:
* Data Collection: Gather historical price data for 5 top-performing assets.
  
* Data Pre-processing: Clean and preprocess both financial and sentiment data, ensuring alignment for analysis.

* VaR Model Development: Explore and implement various VaR methods historical simulation, Monte Carlo simulations.

## 5. Conclusions
* Portfolio Diversification: To mitigate risk associated with the uniform direction of tech stock movements, diversify the portfolio by incorporating non-tech sectors

* Alternative data: Leverage alternative data sources to uncover unique investment opportunities and enhance portfolio decision-making beyond traditional market indicators.
